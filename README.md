# Project "GitGilotyna"

## Description
Project was made as Engineering Thesis by students of `Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Ekonometrii w Krakowie`, with use of `C#` and `Unity Game Engine`

It is a game similar to the titles: Vampire Survivors/Brotato/Yet Another Zombie Survivors/Survivo.io. Our game belongs to action roguelike, bullet hell, RPG genre.
The very idea of ​​the game is to develop the character by playing missions, i.e. randomly selected maps with pseudo-random tasks from the pool.
The gameplay itself consists in surviving constantly incoming waves of enemies (with auto-targeting, as in this type of games), while you have to complete various types of missions (reaching the goal, in subsequent versions: killing X enemies, killing the boss, and a mix of these objectives). Character development consists in collecting coins during the game, which the player can use as part of character development in the main menu, and during the game itself in collecting experience - thanks to which temporary (until the end of the game) upgrades are unlocked, such as additional damage.

Project is currently in alpha stage, so:
+ Most of mechanics are done, but not well tested
+ Content is required minimum to enjoy the game and get sample of game climax
+ Graphics can change in future
